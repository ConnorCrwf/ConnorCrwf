- 👋 Hi, I’m @ConnorCrwf. This is my public repo. Most of my coding is done on a private Github account, associated with the University I attend.
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics and embedded systems. I hope to invent a product soon that I can form a side business around.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and applying robotics to solve a variety of problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything robotics related.
