- 👋 Hi, I’m @ConnorCrwf. This is my public repo. Most of my coding is done on a private Github account, associated with my business and the university I recently graduated from. Also some of my repos on this account are private as they are related to projects I hope to commercialize. 
- 👀 Demo Videos of some of my projects to date are hosted through my carrd website at https://connorcrawford.carrd.co/
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics and embedded systems. I hope to invent a product soon that I can form a side business around.
- 🌱 I’m currently applying robotics to solve a variety of problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything robotics related.
- 📫 Email me at connor.crwf@gmail.com if you'd like to connect. That's also the email attached to my LinkedIn account.
